## Mini-Course in Dynamic Programming

**Requirements:** You are assumed to know basic Python programming. Else see [Introduction to Programming and Numerical Analysis](https://numeconcopenhagen.netlify.com/).

**Intended learning goal:** You are will be equipped to solve state-of-the-art consumption saving models, estimate them and embed them in general equilibrium models.

**Why learn dynamic programming?**

1. **Policy recommendations** are central for all social science
2. Need models for **counter-factual analysis**
3. Realistic models typically have **no analytical solution**
  1. dynamic
  2. multi-dimensional
  3. uncertainty
  4. heterogeneity
  5. learning
4. **Solving such models requires dynamic programming**
5. Estimation gives you **laboratory economies**

**This mini-course:**

1. Go through this notebook, `01. Introduction.ipynb`
2. Go through the notebook, `02. Your First Consumption-Saving Model`
3. Read through the slides `ConsumptionSaving.pdf`
4. Go through `03. A Full Blow Consumption Model.ipynb`
5. Go through `04. Structural Estimation.ipynb`
6. Go through `05. General equilibrium.ipynb`
7. Read the paper [A Guide to Solve Non-Convex Consumption-Saving Models](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1V15dwMIrl_TJGoqu7qauhVWcDm0yqb-D)
8. Go through the notebooks in `../BufferStockModel/` and `../DurableConsumptionModel/`
9. Look at the ekstra material in `../Tools/` and `../Numba and C++/`
