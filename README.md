Contains Jupyter Notebooks showcasing the [ConSav package](https://github.com/NumEconCopenhagen/ConsumptionSaving).

# Getting Started

The main tool in the [ConSav package](https://github.com/NumEconCopenhagen/ConsumptionSaving) is the **ModelClass** class with predefined methods for e.g. saving and loading. The main selling point is that it provides an easy interface to calling Python functions jit compilled with [Numba](http://numba.pydata.org/), and C++ functions. Each concrete model inherits these methods and then adds methods for e.g. solving and simulating. The simplest full example is the canonical buffer-stock consumption model, see the [BufferStockModel notebook](https://github.com/NumEconCopenhagen/ConsumptionSavingNotebooks/blob/master/BufferStockModel/BufferStockModel.ipynb).

The [DurableConsumptioModel notebook](https://github.com/NumEconCopenhagen/ConsumptionSavingNotebooks/blob/master/DurableConsumptionModel/DurableConsumptionModel.ipynb) contains more advanced examples. Specifically, it implements the solution methods proposed in [A Guide On Solving Non-Convex Consumption-Saving Models](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1V15dwMIrl_TJGoqu7qauhVWcDm0yqb-D). See also the [results notebook](https://github.com/NumEconCopenhagen/ConsumptionSavingNotebooks/blob/master/DurableConsumptionModel/A%20Guide%20On%20Solving%20Non-Convex%20Consumption-Saving%20Models.ipynb) for this paper.

**Turtorial:** The **DynamicProgramming/** folder contains a simple introduction to both dynamic programming and the **ConSav** package. If you are **new to Python** then try out this online course, [Introduction to programming and numerical analysis](https://numeconcopenhagen.netlify.com/).

**To get started:**

1. Install the ConSav package (requires git): ``pip install git+https://github.com/NumEconCopenhagen/ConsumptionSaving``
2. Clone or download this repository
3. Open your notebook of choice

We recommend running the notebooks in [JupyerLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/). A set of guides on how to install Python and JupyterLab is available [here](https://numeconcopenhagen.netlify.com/guides/).
